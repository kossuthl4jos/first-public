/*
 An index file indicates that contents of a directory are not meant to be
 imported directly from the outside by convention.

 They are typically created
 when a file grows so large that it makes sense to cut it up, yet its internals
 are not meant to be used from the outside.

 When a directory does not have an index.js in it, all files are up for grabs in it.
